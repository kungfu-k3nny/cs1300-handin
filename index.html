        <h1>Responsive Redesign</h1>
    </header>
    <section>
        <p>I found a poorly designed webpage and redesigned it with functionality, accessibility, and gestalt principles in mind.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h2>Part 1: Identifying Usability Problems</h2>
        <a href="http://bagelgourmetcafe.com/contact-us.html" target="_blank">Visit original website</a>
        <p>I chose the website for a local bagel restaurant in Providence because I frequent the restaurant and also because I noticed how outdated the site appears.</p>
        <h3>Problems:</h3>
        <p>
            1. Lack of spacing between image logo and page title
            2. Lots of unused space on the page
            3. Lack of contrast between the font and the background color
            4. The page lacks symmetry
            5. Content is disparate, lacks flow</p>
        <h3>WebAIM WAIVE report summary:</h3>
            <p>The report highlighted 12 instances of low contrast, which is consistent with problems I identified earlier. It also reported 5 instances of very small text, which may be hard for people with bad vision to read. I personally found it nearly impossible to read the top line of text on the page because it was tiny and its color blended in nearly completely with the background. There are also no aria labels, which would make the webpage inaccessible entirely to screen readers. </p>

        <h2>Part 2: Visual Redesign</h2>
        <h3>Speed sketching:</h3>
        <img alt="speed sketch" src="./assets/speed_sketch.jpg"/>
        <p>I made 9 separate sketches each within 1 minute to brainstorm visual ideas for the redesigned webpage.</p>
        <h3>Final sketch:</h3>
        <img alt="final sketch" src="./assets/final_sketch.jpg"/>
        <p>I chose elements from the first and third speed sketch since the elements aren't distracting from the functionality of the page.</p>
        <h3>Low fidelety wireframing (tablet):</h3>
        <img alt="tablet wire" src="./assets/tablet_wire.jpg"/>
        <p>1. Adequate spacing between texts and features</p>
        <p>2. Full and efficient use of space</p>
        <p>3. Strong color contrast between font and background</p>
        <p>4. Symmetrical positioning of features and text</p>
        <p>5. Buttons, text, and text boxes are laid out in patterns to facilitate user flow
        </p>
        <h3>Low fidelety wireframing (mobile):</h3>
        <img alt="mobile wire" src="./assets/mobile_wire.jpg"/>
        <p>1. Adequate spacing between texts and features </p>
        <p>2. Full and efficient use of space</p>
        <p>3. Strong color contrast between font and background</p>
        <p>4. Symmetrical positioning of features and text</p>
        <p>5. Text, and text boxes are laid out in patterns to facilitate user flow</p>
        <p>6. Burger menu replacing top menu to account for the smaller screen size</p>
        </p>
        <h3>Low fidelety wireframing (desktop):</h3>
        <img alt="desktop wire" src="./assets/desktop_wire.jpg" style="transform: rotate(270deg);"/>
        <p>1. Adequate spacing between texts and features
        <p>2. Efficient use of space, although not full due to the lack of content the page needs to display for necessary function</p>
        <p>3. Strong color contrast between font and background</p>
        <p>4. Symmetrical positioning of features and text</p>
        <p>5. Buttons, text, and text boxes are laid out in patterns to facilitate user flow</p>
        </p>
        <h3>Visual design style guide:</h3>
        <img alt="style guide" src="./assets/style_guide.png"/>
        <p>I decided to make some changes from the low fidelity wireframes. Firstly, the original cursive font may be hard for some people to read, so I changed the font to mate SC. The serifs will also increase legibility especially for dyslexic individuals. I also added icons to aid users who are hard of seeing or are unable to understand english. </p>
        <h3>High fidelety mockup (tablet):</h3>
        <img alt="tablet hifi" src="./assets/tablet_hifi.png"/>
        <h3>High fidelety mockup (mobile):</h3>
        <img alt="mobile hifi" src="./assets/mobile_hifi.png"/>
        <h3>High fidelety mockup (desktop):</h3>
        <img alt="desktop hifi" src="./assets/desktop_hifi.png"/>

        <p>My main takeaway was that refining details for accessibility go a long way. Although work is meticulous, the result will look amazing, and I bet users with disabilities would love the improvmenets.</p>
